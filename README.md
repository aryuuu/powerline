# Powerline

Beautiful powerline-style prompt written in pure bash, simple and very fast.

## Features

Prints username and current path. Too long paths are shortened.

## How to use

Include powerline.sh in `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file:

```bash
source "/path/to/powerline.sh"
```

That's all!

You can customize colors and appearance, just look inside [powerline.sh](powerline.sh).
